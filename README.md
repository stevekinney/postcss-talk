# PostCSS Talk

Notes from my talk at SendGrid's Frontend Guild.

## Resources

### Popular Plugins

- First of all, check out this [epic list](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#plugins).
- [Rucksack](http://simplaio.github.io/rucksack/) is a collection of plugins.
- [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) allows you to use CSS from the future.

### Working with Sass

- Generally speaking, you can turn your SCSS into CSS and then pump it into PostCSS.
- Alternatively, if you're more interested in parsing SCSS and doing some magic with PostCSS, then use [this](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss).
- [PreCSS](https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss) is a collection of plugins that recreate something suspiciously like Sass.
